/**
 * A <i>thread</i> is a thread of execution in a program. The Java
 * Virtual Machine allows an application to have multiple threads of
 * execution running concurrently.
 * <p>
 * Every thread has a priority. Threads with higher priority are
 * executed in preference to threads with lower priority. Each thread
 * may or may not also be marked as a daemon. When code running in
 * some thread creates a new <code>Thread</code> object, the new
 * thread has its priority initially set equal to the priority of the
 * creating thread, and is a daemon thread if and only if the
 * creating thread is a daemon.
 * <p>
 * When a Java Virtual Machine starts up, there is usually a single
 * non-daemon thread (which typically calls the method named
 * <code>main</code> of some designated class). The Java Virtual
 * Machine continues to execute threads until either of the following
 * occurs:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The <code>exit</code> method of class <code>Runtime</code> has been
 *     called and the security manager has permitted the exit operation
 *     to take place.
 * <li>All threads that are not daemon threads have died, either by
 *     returning from the call to the <code>run</code> method or by
 *     throwing an exception that propagates beyond the <code>run</code>
 *     method.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * There are two ways to create a new thread of execution. One is to
 * declare a class to be a subclass of <code>Thread</code>. This
 * subclass should override the <code>run</code> method of class
 * <code>Thread</code>. An instance of the subclass can then be
 * allocated and started. For example, a thread that computes primes
 * larger than a stated value could be written as follows:
 * <hr><blockquote><pre>
 *     class PrimeThread extends Thread {
 *         long minPrime;
 *         PrimeThread(long minPrime) {
 *             this.minPrime = minPrime;
 *         }
 *
 *         public void run() {
 *             // compute primes larger than minPrime
 *             &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
 *         }
 *     }
 * </pre></blockquote><hr>
 * <p>
 * The following code would then create a thread and start it running:
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     PrimeThread p = new PrimeThread(143);
 *     p.start();
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * <p>
 * The other way to create a thread is to declare a class that
 * implements the <code>Runnable</code> interface. That class then
 * implements the <code>run</code> method. An instance of the class can
 * then be allocated, passed as an argument when creating
 * <code>Thread</code>, and started. The same example in this other
 * style looks like the following:
 * <hr><blockquote><pre>
 *     class PrimeRun implements Runnable {
 *         long minPrime;
 *         PrimeRun(long minPrime) {
 *             this.minPrime = minPrime;
 *         }
 *
 *         public void run() {
 *             // compute primes larger than minPrime
 *             &nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
 *         }
 *     }
 * </pre></blockquote><hr>
 * <p>
 * The following code would then create a thread and start it running:
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     PrimeRun p = new PrimeRun(143);
 *     new Thread(p).start();
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * <p>
 * Every thread has a name for identification purposes. More than
 * one thread may have the same name. If a name is not specified when
 * a thread is created, a new name is generated for it.
 * <p>
 * Unless otherwise noted, passing a {@code null} argument to a constructor
 * or method in this class will cause a {@link NullPointerException} to be
 * thrown.

 * 进程的基本原理
 *  在计算机中，CPU 是核心的硬件资源，承担了所有的计算任务；内存资源承担了运行时数据的保存任务；外部资源承担了数据外部永久存储的任务。其中，计算任务
 *  的调度、资源的分配由操作系统来统领。应用程序以进程的形式运行在操作系统之上，享受操作系统提供的服务。
 *  进程的定义一直以来没有完美的标准。一般来说，一个进程由程序段、数据段和进程控制块三部分组成。
 *      程序段一般也称代码段。代码段是进程的程序指令在内存中的位置，包含需要执行的指令集合；
 *      数据段是进程操作的数据 在内存中的位置，包含需要操作的数据集合；
 *      程序控制块包含进程的描述信息和控制信息，是进程存在的唯一标识；
 *  PCB 主要由四大部分组成：
 *      （1）进程的描述信息。主要包括：进程的ID 和进程的名称，进程ID 是唯一的，代表进程的身份；进程的状态，比如运行、就绪、阻塞；进程的优先级，是
 *      进程调度的重要依据。
 *      （2）进程的调度信息。主要包括：程序的起始地址，程序的第一行指令的内存地址，从这里开始程序的执行；通信信息，进程间通信时的消息队列。
 *      （3）进程的资源信息。主要包括：内存信息，内存占用情况和内存管理所用的数据结构；I/O 设备信息，所有的I/O 设备编号及相应数据结构；文件句柄，
 *      所打开文件的信息。
 *      （4）进程上下文。主要包括：执行时各种CPU 寄存器的值、当前的程序计数器（PC）的值以及各种栈的值等，即进程的环境。在操作系统切换进程时，当前
 *      进程被迫让出CPU，当前进程的上下文就保存在PCB 结构中，供下次恢复运行时使用。
 *  现代操作系统中，进程是并发执行的，任何进程都可以同其他进程一起进行。在进程内部，代码段和数据段有自己的独立地址空间，不同进程的地址空间是相互隔离的。
 *
 * 线程的基本原理
 *  早期的操作系统只有进程而没有线程。进程是程序执行和系统进行并发调度的最小单位。随着计算机的发展，CPU 的性能越来越高，从早期的20MHz 发展到现在2GHz
 *  以上，从单核CPU 发展到了多核CPU，性能提升了成千上万倍。为了发挥CPU 的计算性能，提升CPU 的硬件资源的利用率，同时弥补进程调度过于笨重产生的问题，
 *  进程内部演进出了并发调度的诉求，于是发明了线程。
 *  线程是指”进程代码段“的一次顺序执行流程。线程是CPU 调度的最小单位。一个进程可以有一个或多个线程，各个线程之间共享进程的内存空间、系统资源，进程仍
 *  是操作系统资源分配的最小单位。
 *  Java 程序的进程执行过程就是一个标准的多线程的执行过程。每当使用Java 命令执行一个Class 类时，实际上就是启动了一个JVM 进程。理论上，在该进程的
 *  内部至少会启动两个线程，一个Main 线程，另一个是GC 线程。实际上，执行一个Java 程序后，线程数量远远不止两个，达到了18个之多。可以通过Windows
 *  工具Process Explorer 来观察。
 *  一个标准的线程主要由三部分组成，线程描述信息、程序计数器和栈内存。
 *      线程描述信息即线程的基本信息，主要包括：
 *      （1）线程ID。线程的唯一标识，同一个进程内不同的线程ID 不会重复。
 *      （2）线程名称。主要是方便用户识别，用户可以指定线程的名字，如果没有指定，系统就会自动分配一个名称。
 *      （3）线程优先级。表示线程调度的优先级，优先级越高，获得CPU 的执行机会就越大。
 *      （4）线程状态。表示当前线程的执行状态，在系统级别只有四种新建、就绪、运行、终止。
 *      程序计数器很重要，它记录着线程下一条指令的代码段内存地址。
 *      栈内存是代码段中局部变量的存储空间，为线程所独立拥有，在线程之间不共享。
 *  在Java 中，执行程序流程的重要单位是“方法”，而栈内存的分配单位是“栈帧”。方法的每一次执行都需要为其分配一个栈帧，主要包括该方法中的局部变量、方法
 *  的返回地址以及其他方法的相关信息。当线程的执行流程进入方法时，JVM 就会为方法分配一个对应的栈帧压入栈内存；当线程执行流程跳出方法时，JVM 就从栈
 *  内存中弹出该方法的栈帧，此时方法栈帧的内存就会被回收，栈帧中的变量就会被销毁。
 *
 * 进程与线程的区别
 *  线程的上下文切换要比进程的上下文切换速度快的多，所以这也就是为什么要引入线程的原因。
 *  进程可以看做是Java 中的线程池，而线程可以看做是Java 中线程池的线程。
 *  线程是CPU 调度的最小单位，进程是操作系统分配资源的最小单位。
 *
 * 线程的调度方式是：基于CPU 时间片方式进程线程调度。线程只有得到CPU 时间片才能执行指令，处于执行状态，没有得到时间片的线程处于就绪状态，等待线程分
 * 配下一个CPU 时间片。由于时间片非常短，在各个线程之间快速的切换，因此表现出来的特征是很多个线程在“同时执行” 或者“并发执行”。
 * 线程的调度模型有两种：分时调度模型和抢占式调度模型。
 * （1）分时调度模型：系统平均分配CPU 的时间片，所有线程轮流占用CPU。分时调度模型在时间片调度的分配上，所有线程”人人均等“。
 * （2）抢占式调度模型：系统按照线程优先级分配CPU 时间片。优先级越高的线程，优先分配CPU 时间片，如果所有就绪线程的优先级相同，那么会随机选一个，优
 * 先级高的线程获得的CPU 时间片相对多一些。
 *
 * 由于目前大部分操作系统都是使用抢占式调度模型进行线程调度，Java 的线程管理和调度是委托给操作系统完成的，与之相应的，Java 的线程调度也是使用抢占式
 * 调度模型，因此Java 的线程都有优先级。

     *
     * <p>The virtual machine is free to treat the {@code stackSize}
     * parameter as a suggestion.  If the specified value is unreasonably low
     * for the platform, the virtual machine may instead use some
     * platform-specific minimum value; if the specified value is unreasonably
     * high, the virtual machine may instead use some platform-specific
     * maximum.  Likewise, the virtual machine is free to round the specified
     * value up or down as it sees fit (or to ignore it completely).
     *
     * <p>Specifying a value of zero for the {@code stackSize} parameter will

     *
     * <p><i>Due to the platform-dependent nature of the behavior of this

     * The thread stack size necessary to perform a given computation will
     * likely vary from one JRE implementation to another.  In light of this

     * （1）如果此线程处于阻塞状态，就会立马退出阻塞，并抛出InterruptedException 异常，线程就可以通过捕获InterruptedException 来做一定的处
     * 理，然后让线程退出。更确切的说，如果线程被Object#wait、Thread#join、Thread#sleep 阻塞，此时调用该线程的interrupt 方法，该线程将抛出
     * 一个InterruptedException 中断异常。
     * （2）如果此线程处于运行状态，线程就不会受任何影响，继续运行，仅仅是线程的中断标记被设置为true。所以，程序可以在适当的位置通过调用isInterrupted
     * 方法来查看自己是否被中断，并执行退出操作。
     *
     * 自定义中断标识位和使用interrupt 的区别：
